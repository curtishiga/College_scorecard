# College_scorecard
This repository focuses on cleaning up the College Scorecard data set found at https://data.world/education/college-scorecard.

The purpose of this data set is to help students pick a university that's a good match based on their academics, finances, etc. Data was taken from the 1996-1997 to 2014-2015 school years.
